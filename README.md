# My Neighborhood React App

## Project Description

This app is a project made with React for the completion of the [Udacity's Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001?v=fe1).

## Instructions

Build a single page map application using React and the Google Maps API. Integrate a third-party data API and make the app accessible, responsive and usable.

## How to start

1. Clone or download the repository;

2. Inside of the root folder, create a .env file where to store the API keys for Google Maps and Foursquare. The file has the following structure (notations between quotes must be replaced with the actual API keys):

            REACT_APP_GM_API_KEY="Google Maps API key"
            REACT_APP_FSQ_CLIENTID="Foursquare Client ID"
            REACT_APP_FSQ_CLIENTSECRET="Foursquare Client Secret"

3. In the terminal, cd into the root folder, and input the command `$ npm install` to install the dependencies.

4. Type `$ npm start`. The app will open in the browser automatically.
